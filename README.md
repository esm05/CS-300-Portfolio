# CS-300-Portfolio
An overview of the completed Project 2 @ SNHU


### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- The problem we were trying to solve was storing and displaying course information about courses with a course ID, title, and prerequisites if any belonging to the course for the client ABC University.
  
### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- Throughout the course, we learned about different data structures and their strengths and weaknesses for different algorithms. Data structures are important to understand because they are the foundation of computer programming. Efficiently storing information is useful for projects that have thousands of objects that will be hindered by inefficient data structures or poor implementation.
  
### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- Visting tutoring services made me readjust my approach. While working on the BST activities I was getting a stack overflow error for my program and I didn't understand why as the program worked for the smaller data set but not the large data set that potentially produced 12,000 individual objects. Originally in my program, I used recursion functions to manipulate the data structure but realized that was a poor implementation even though recursion is useful for small sample sizes when the data gets into the thousands the machine runs out of memory and crashes.
  
### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- It made me realize there was more precoding than I had originally thought of course it is important to write pseudocode or make a flowchart for a program. Additionally by analyzing different data structures and their worst-case scenario or big-o notation is useful for developing a solution to a problem especially if the size of the data is unknown.
  
### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- This part I was already familiar with and I was annoyed by the .zip files because the "driver" file or main was too crowded and the function, class, and struct declarations could have been moved to a different file.
